# SnapChatEngineeringProject
Website built for the snapchat engineering project assessment! Featuring a small LA Veterinarian's office named Little Cottonwood Animal Hospital.

I chose Little Cottonwood Animal Hospital because I had my dog pass away 2 weeks ago and he has been on my mind alot recently. So I thought what better way to honor him than by creating a special page for him on this website for a beautiful Veterinarian's office that works everyday to save dogs lives. This is my first time coding a website and I hope the work I put into it really shows. RIP Duke <3
