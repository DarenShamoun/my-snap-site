# SnapChatEngineeringProject
Website built for the snapchat engineering project assessment! Featuring a small LA business named Little Cottonwood Animal Hospital.

I have never created a website using JS or Vue or any other coding language to be honest, 
Personally have only used plug and play tools to create my own websites thus far and I have kept my distance from front end. 
However I thought it would be cool to learn something new and exciting and I saw this as the perfect opportunity to challenge myself! 
I asked around my friend group who are mainly front end developers and they recommended Vue.js.
I read the documentation and it gave me echos of when I learned JavaFX *shutters* but this seemed more modular and easier to work with overall.
